### How to Use
to Use OSS...
From github, download OSS, and run.
Main Menu displays 4 buttons:
    1. Download Github Repos
    	Enter a github url.  If a repo does not exist on the local machine, a repo will be downloaded. If the repo already exists on the local machine, the user chooses git reset-hard (overwrites local machine folder) or git-pull (pulls only changes and keeps other edits).
    2. Generate Comments File 
    	A comments file will be generated from the repo that was downloaded from github.  If a comments file already exists on the local machine, the user will acknowledge that this comments file will be overwritten with the new comments file generated.
    3. Apply Spelling Corrections
    	After the user applies the spelling corrections to the latest comments file, the changes will be applied to the repo files and sent back to github.
    4. Exit OSS
    	The user will exit the OSS program.
